# Rocket Blaster

A shoot 'em up game in outer space.

Built by [@cory_laviska](https://x.com/cory_laviska) using Grok 3 and a sprinkle of Claude because I ran out of credits.

Have fun!

## Local development

Run `npm install` to ensure dev dependencies are installed, then launch the game locally.

```sh
npm start
```

## Ideas

- [ ] add sounds
- [ ] ability to select ship color
- [ ] black hole
  - appears for 10 seconds
  - scales in but doesn't move
  - sucks in asteroids and maybe the rocket with gravitational physics when too close
