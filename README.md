# Rocket Blaster

A shoot 'em up game in outer space.

Built by [@cory_laviska](https://x.com/cory_laviska) using Grok 3 and a sprinkle of Claude because I ran out of credits.

Have fun!

## Local development

Run `npm install` to ensure dev dependencies are installed, then launch the game locally.

```sh
npm start
```

## Ideas

- scale the game down on phones
- ship color selection
- black hole
  - appears for 10 seconds
  - scales in but doesn't move
  - sucks in asteroids and maybe the rocket with gravitational physics when too close
- sounds
  - ability to turn on/off with icon at top right
  - when the game first starts: ?
  - when you shoot (need to crop): https://audiojungle.net/item/space-gun/17362803
