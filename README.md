# Rocket Blaster

A shoot 'em up game in outer space.

Built by [@cory_laviska](https://x.com/cory_laviska) using Grok 3 and a sprinkle of Claude because I ran out of credits.

Have fun!

## Local development

Run `npm install` to ensure dev dependencies are installed, then launch the game locally.

```sh
npm start
```

## Ideas

- add sound
- show elapsed time
- show accuracy rate
- coins to collect
- maintain the high score and show it on the menu
