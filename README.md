# Rocket Blaster

A shoot 'em up game in outer space. Blast asteroids, grab power ups, and avoid black holes!

Built by [@cory_laviska](https://x.com/cory_laviska) using Grok 3 and a sprinkle of Claude.

Have fun! ðŸš€

## Local development

Run `npm install` to ensure dev dependencies are installed, then launch the game locally.

```sh
npm start
```

## Ideas

- [ ] add color slider to select ship color (saved to localStorage; reset button)
- [ ] add power up like shield but it lets you shoot a spread of 3-5 bullets instead of one until it runs out
