# Rocket Blaster

A shoot 'em up game in outer space. Blast asteroids, grab power ups, and avoid black holes!

Built by [@cory_laviska](https://x.com/cory_laviska) using Grok 3 and a sprinkle of Claude.

Have fun! ðŸš€

## Local development

Run `npm install` to ensure dev dependencies are installed, then launch the game locally.

```sh
npm start
```

## Ideas

- [ ] add color slider to select ship color (saved to localStorage; reset button)
- [ ] Pressing shift will make the rocket's max speed a bit faster
- [ ] Pressing T will toggle the tracer, a thin dashed line that spans from the nose of the ship to a certain distance away indicating the direction the bullets will fire.
- [ ] When you have a 3+ streak, the ship starts shooting a spread of three bullets
